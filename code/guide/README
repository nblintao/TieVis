GUIDE Readme file
==================

System Requirements
======================
The GUIDE system has been tested and run on a PIII-500 MHZ system with 384 
MB of RAM. It requires little system memory and should be able to run on 
any PII-300 MHZ and up. Testing has not been conducted in such 
environments, however, so there might be deterioration in peformace.

   O/S and Compiler
=======================
The operating system that GUIDE was written on and compiled under :
Red Hat Linux 7.0 release 2.4.2.  
The compiler used is:
gcc version 2.96 20000731
as shown by issuing 'gcc -v'.
GUIDE has not been tested under Windows but should run under any Unix type 
system.

Installation Instructions
===========================
To install GUIDE run 'make' to compile all the files and then run 'wish 
graph.tcl' to start the user interface.  Note that compilation only needs 
to be performed once but the second command should be used to start the 
application every time.
